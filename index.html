SOAC stands for <b>S</b>hell-<b>O</b>ptimized <b>A</b>tomic <b>C</b>onfinement, which is a procedure we applied to generating Slater-Koster parametrizations with accurate electronic structure predictions for solid compounds formed by elements across the periodic table.

Our optimization procedure is described in this article:<BR/ >

With this publication, we released SOAC parametrizations for all transition metals, and these parametrizations can be obtained from our <a href="https://github.com/Voss-Lab/SK_repository">SK_repository</a>.<BR />
The parameters can be used with tight-binding codes compatible with the <code>SK</code> file format, such as <a href="https://dftbplus.org/">DFTB+ code</a>.
